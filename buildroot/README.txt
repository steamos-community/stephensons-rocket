                      Welcome to the exciting world of
                              Debian GNU/Linux

   This is one disc in a set containing the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
   Debian is a very extensive collection of software. But it is more. It
   is a complete Operating System (OS) for your computer. And it is free
   (as in "freedom").

Introduction
============

   An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that
   make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the
   kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer,
   which does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other
   programs. Debian is kernel independent. It currently uses either the
   Linux or FreeBSD kernel. Most of the basic operating system tools come
   from the GNU project; hence the name GNU/Linux.

   Debian is available for various kinds of computers ("architectures"),
   like "IBM-compatible" PCs (i386), Compaq's Alpha, Sun's Sparc,
   Motorola/IBM's PowerPC, and (Strong)ARM processors. Check the ports
   page for more information.

About This Disc
===============

   This disc is labeled

      SteamOS GNU/Linux 1.0 "Alchemist" - Unofficial Multi-architecture
                      amd64/i386 DVD #1 20131213-01:12

   which means that this disc is number 1 of a set of 1 discs It
   contains programs ("binaries") for `amd64/i386' computers.

   The programs on the Binary discs are ordered by popularity. The
   Binary-1 disc contains the most popular programs and the installation
   tools; it is possible to install and run Debian with only the Binary-1
   disc. The other discs, up to Binary-1, contain mostly
   special-interest programs.

   This disc includes non-free firmware to make installation easier on
   some systems requiring proprietary but redistributable firmware. See
   http://wiki.debian.org/Firmware for more details.

Installing
==========

   Because Debian is a complete Operating System, the installation
   procedure may seem a bit unusual. You can install Debian GNU/Linux
   either alongside your current OS, or as the only OS on your computer.

   As this is not an official wheezy release disc, then the installation
   guide many not be released yet. It will appear on the Debian web site
   when ready, but before then you could try the development version of
   the manual.

   For the impatient ones: you can start the installation program easily
   by booting off this disc. Note that not all (esp. older) systems
   support this.

   You can also examine the /install/ directory; you might be able to
   start the installation system directly from there.

Last-Minute Notes
=================

     * You should keep in mind that this is an unofficial disc of the
       Debian system. This means that all sorts of bugs may be present
       anywhere in the system. Please report any bugs you find to the
       person that gave you this disc, not Debian.
     * If you're reporting bugs against this disc or the installation
       system, please also mention the version of this disc; this can be
       found in the file /.disk/info.

Installing software using Apt
=============================

   After installing or upgrading, Debian's packaging system can use CDs,
   DVDs, local collections, or networked servers (FTP, HTTP) to
   automatically install software from (.deb packages). This is done
   preferably with the `apt' and `aptitude' programs.

   You can install packages from the commandline using apt-get. For
   example, if you want to install the packages `commprog' and `maxgame',
   you can give the command:

     apt-get install commprog maxgame

   Note that you don't have to enter the complete path, or the `.deb'
   extension. `Apt' will figure this out itself.

   Or use aptitude for a full screen interactive selection of available
   Debian packages.

CD/DVD Manufacturers
====================

   You are completely free to manufacture and re-distribute CDs/DVDs of
   the Debian GNU/Linux Operating System, like this one. There is no
   charge from us (but of course donations are always welcome).
