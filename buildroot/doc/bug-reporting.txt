   Debian bug tracking system / Debian BTS - reporting bugs

How to report a bug in Debian using reportbug

   We strongly recommend that you report bugs in Debian using the
   reportbug program. To install and start it, simply run:

     # aptitude install reportbug
     $ reportbug

   It will guide you through the bug reporting process step by step.

   If you have questions that the interactive prompts of reportbug do not
   resolve, you can refer to the rest of the documentation below or ask
   the Debian user mailing list.

How to report a bug in Debian using email (and advanced usage of reportbug)

Important things to note before sending your bug report

What package does your bug report belong to?

   You need to know what package your bug report should be filed against.
   See this example for information on how to find this information. (You
   will use this information to see if your bug report has been filed
   already.)

   If you are unable to determine which package your bug report should be
   filed against, please send e-mail to the Debian user mailing list
   asking for advice.

   If your problem doesn't relate just to one package but some general
   Debian service, there are several pseudo-packages or even mailing lists
   that you can use to relay your message to us instead.

Has your bug report been filed already?

   You should check to see if your bug report has already been filed
   before submitting it. You can see which bugs have been filed in a
   specific package using the package option of the bug search form. If
   there is an existing bug report #<number>, you should submit your
   comments by sending e-mail to <number>@bugs.debian.org instead of
   reporting a new bug.

Send multiple reports for multiple bugs

   Please don't report multiple unrelated bugs -- especially ones in
   different packages -- in a single bug report.

Don't file bugs upstream

   If you file a bug in Debian, don't send a copy to the upstream software
   maintainers yourself, as it is possible that the bug exists only in
   Debian. If necessary, the maintainer of the package will forward the
   bug upstream.

Sending the bug report via e-mail

   You can report bugs in Debian by sending an e-mail to
   submit@bugs.debian.org with a special format described below. reportbug
   (see above) will properly format the e-mails for you; please use it!

Headers

   Like any e-mail you should include a clear, descriptive Subject line in
   your main mail header. The subject you give will be used as the initial
   bug title in the tracking system, so please try to make it informative!

   If you'd like to send a copy of your bug report to additional
   recipients (such as mailing lists), you shouldn't use the usual e-mail
   headers, but a different method, described below.

Pseudo-headers

   The first part of the bug report are the pseudo-headers which contain
   information about what package and version your bug report applies to.
   The first line of the message body has to include a pseudo-header. It
   should say:
Package: <packagename>

   Replace <packagename> with the name of the package which has the bug.

   The second line of the message should say:
Version: <packageversion>

   Replace <packageversion> with the version of the package. Please don't
   include any text here other than the version itself, as the bug
   tracking system relies on this field to work out which releases are
   affected by the bug.

   You need to supply a correct Package line in the pseudo-header in order
   for the bug tracking system to deliver the message to the package's
   maintainer. See this example for information on how to find this
   information.

   For other valid pseudo-headers, see Additional pseudo-headers

The body of the report

   Please include in your report:
     * The exact and complete text of any error messages printed or
       logged. This is very important!
     * Exactly what you typed or did to demonstrate the problem.
     * A description of the incorrect behavior: exactly what behavior you
       were expecting, and what you observed. A transcript of an example
       session is a good way of showing this.
     * A suggested fix, or even a patch, if you have one.
     * Details of the configuration of the program with the problem.
       Include the complete text of its configuration files.
     * The versions of any packages on which the buggy package depends.
     * What kernel version you're using (type uname -a), your shared C
       library (type ls -l /lib/libc.so.6 or dpkg -s libc6 | grep
       ^Version), and any other details about your Debian system, if it
       seems appropriate. For example, if you had a problem with a Perl
       script, you would want to provide the version of the `perl' binary
       (type perl -v or dpkg -s perl | grep ^Version:).
     * Appropriate details of the hardware in your system. If you're
       reporting a problem with a device driver please list all the
       hardware in your system, as problems are often caused by IRQ and
       I/O address conflicts.
     * If you have reportbug installed the output of reportbug -q
       --template -T none -s none -S normal -b --list-cc none -q <package>
       will also be useful, as it contains the output of maintainer
       specific scripts and version information.

   Include any detail that seems relevant -- you are in very little danger
   of making your report too long by including too much information. If
   they are small, please include in your report any files you were using
   to reproduce the problem. (If they are large, consider making them
   available on a publicly available website if possible.)

   For more advice on how to help the developers solve your problem,
   please read How to Report Bugs Effectively.

An Example Bug Report

   A bug report with header and pseudo-header looks something like this:
  To: submit@bugs.debian.org
  From: diligent@testing.linux.org
  Subject: Hello says `goodbye'

  Package: hello
  Version: 1.3-16

  When I invoke `hello' without arguments from an ordinary shell
  prompt it prints `goodbye', rather than the expected `hello, world'.
  Here is a transcript:

  $ hello
  goodbye
  $ /usr/bin/hello
  goodbye
  $

  I suggest that the output string, in hello.c, be corrected.

  I am using Debian GNU/Linux 2.2, kernel 2.2.17-pre-patch-13
  and libc6 2.1.3-10.

Sending copies of bug reports to other addresses

   Sometimes it is necessary to send a copy of a bug report to somewhere
   else besides debian-bugs-dist and the package maintainer, which is
   where they are normally sent.

   You could do this by CC'ing your bug report to the other address(es),
   but then the other copies would not have the bug report number put in
   the Reply-To field and the Subject line. When the recipients reply they
   will probably preserve the submit@bugs.debian.org entry in the header
   and have their message filed as a new bug report. This leads to many
   duplicated reports.

   The right way to do this is to use the X-Debbugs-CC header. Add a line
   like this to your message's mail header:
 X-Debbugs-CC: other-list@cosmic.edu

   This will cause the bug tracking system to send a copy of your report
   to the address(es) in the X-Debbugs-CC line as well as to
   debian-bugs-dist.

   Avoid sending such copies to the addresses of other bug reports, as
   they will be caught by the checks that prevent mail loops. There is
   relatively little point in using X-Debbugs-CC for this anyway, as the
   bug number added by that mechanism will just be replaced by a new one;
   use an ordinary CC header instead.

   This feature can often be combined usefully with mailing quiet -- see
   below.

Additional Pseudoheaders

Severity levels

   If a report is of a particularly serious bug, or is merely a feature
   request, you can set the severity level of the bug as you report it.
   This is not required however, and the package maintainer will assign an
   appropriate severity level to your report even if you do not (or pick
   the wrong severity).

   To assign a severity level, put a line like this one in the
   pseudo-header:
Severity: <severity>

   Replace <severity> with one of the available severity levels, as
   described in the advanced documentation.

Assigning tags

   You can set tags on a bug as you are reporting it. For example, if you
   are including a patch with your bug report, you may wish to set the
   patch tag. This is not required, however, and the developers will set
   tags on your report as and when it is appropriate.

   To set tags, put a line like this one in the pseudo-header:
Tags: <tags>

   Replace <tags> with one or more of the available tags, as described in
   the advanced documentation. Separate multiple tags with commas, spaces,
   or both.
User: <username>
Usertags: <usertags>

   Replace <usertags> with one or more usertags. Separate multiple tags
   with commas, spaces, or both. If you specify a <username>, that user's
   tags will be set. Otherwise, the e-mail address of the sender will be
   used as the username.

Setting Forwarded

Forwarded: foo@example.com

   will mark the newly submitted bug as forwarded to foo@example.com. See
   Recording that you have passed on a bug report in the developers'
   documentation for details.

Claiming ownership

Owner: foo@example.com

   will indicate that foo@example.com is now responsible for fixing this
   bug. See Changing bug ownership in the developers' documentation for
   details.

Source Package

Source: foopackage

   the equivalent of Package: for bugs present in the source package of
   foopackage; for most bugs in most packages you don't want to use this
   option.

Control Commands

Control: control commands

   Allows for any of the commands which must be sent to
   control@bugs.debian.org to work when sent to submit@bugs.debian.org or
   nnn@bugs.debian.org. -1 initially refers to the current bug (that is,
   the bug created by a mail to submit@ or the bug messaged with nnn@).
   Please see the server control documentation for more information on the
   control commands which are valid.

   For example, the following pseudoheader in a message sent to
   12345@bugs.debian.org:
Control: retitle -1 this is the title
Control: severity -1 normal
Control: summary -1 0
Control: forward -1 http://bugs.debian.org/nnn

   would cause 12345 to be retitled, its severity changed, summary set,
   and marked as forwarded.

X-Debbugs- headers

   Finally, if your MUA doesn't allow you to edit the headers, you can set
   the various X-Debbugs- headers in the pseudo-headers.

Additional information

Different submission addresses (minor or mass bug reports)

   If a bug report is minor, for example, a documentation typo or a
   trivial build problem, please adjust the severity appropriately and
   send it to maintonly@bugs.debian.org instead of submit@bugs.debian.org.
   maintonly will forward the report to the package maintainer only, it
   won't forward it to the BTS mailing lists.

   If you're submitting many reports at once, you should definitely use
   maintonly@bugs.debian.org so that you don't cause too much redundant
   traffic on the BTS mailing lists. Before submitting many similar bugs
   you may also want to post a summary on debian-bugs-dist.

   If wish to report a bug to the bug tracking system that's already been
   sent to the maintainer, you can use quiet@bugs.debian.org. Bugs sent to
   quiet@bugs.debian.org will not be forwarded anywhere, only filed.

   When you use different submission addresses, the bug tracking system
   will set the Reply-To of any forwarded message so that the replies will
   by default be processed in the same way as the original report. That
   means that, for example, replies to maintonly will go to
   nnn-maintonly@bugs.debian.org instead of nnn@bugs.debian.org, unless of
   course one overrides this manually.

Acknowledgements

   Normally, the bug tracking system will return an acknowledgement to you
   by e-mail when you report a new bug or submit additional information to
   an existing bug. If you want to suppress this acknowledgement, include
   an X-Debbugs-No-Ack header or pseudoheader in your e-mail (the contents
   of this header do not matter). If you report a new bug with this
   header, you will need to check the web interface yourself to find the
   bug number.

   Note that this header will not suppress acknowledgements from the
   control@bugs.debian.org mailserver, since those acknowledgements may
   contain error messages which should be read and acted upon.

Spamfighting and missing mail

   The bug tracking system implements a rather extensive set of rules
   designed to make sure that spam does not make it through the BTS. While
   we try to minimize the number of false positives, they do occur. If you
   suspect your mail has triggered a false positive, feel free to contact
   owner@bugs.debian.org for assistance. Another common cause of mail not
   making it through to the BTS is utilizing addresses which match
   procmail's FROM_DAEMON, which includes mail from addresses like
   mail@foobar.com. If you suspect your mail matches FROM_DAEMON, see
   procmailrc(5) to verify, and then resend the mail using an address
   which does not match FROM_DAEMON.

Bug reports against unknown packages

   If the bug tracking system doesn't know who the maintainer of the
   relevant package is it will forward the report to debian-bugs-dist even
   if maintonly was used.

   When sending to maintonly@bugs.debian.org or
   nnn-maintonly@bugs.debian.org you should make sure that the bug report
   is assigned to the right package, by putting a correct Package at the
   top of an original submission of a report, or by using the
   control@bugs.debian.org service to (re)assign the report appropriately.

Using dpkg to find the package and version for the report

   When using reportbug to report a bug in a command, say grep, the
   following will automatically select the right package and let you write
   the report right away: reportbug --file $(which grep)

   You can also find out which package installed it by using dpkg
   --search. You can find out which version of a package you have
   installed by using dpkg --list or dpkg --status.

   For example:
$ which apt-get
/usr/bin/apt-get
$ type apt-get
apt-get is /usr/bin/apt-get
$ dpkg --search /usr/bin/apt-get
apt: /usr/bin/apt-get
$ dpkg --list apt
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge/Hold
| Status=Not/Installed/Config-files/Unpacked/Failed-config/Half-installed
|/ Err?=(none)/Hold/Reinst-required/X=both-problems (Status,Err: uppercase=bad)
||/ Name           Version        Description

Other useful commands and packages

   The querybts tool, available from the same package as reportbug,
   provides a convenient text-based interface to the bug tracking system.

   Emacs users can also use the debian-bug command provided by the
   debian-el package. When called with M-x debian-bug, it will ask for all
   necessary information in a similar way to reportbug.
