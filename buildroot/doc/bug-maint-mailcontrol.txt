   Debian bug tracking system / Debian BTS -- control server

Introduction to the bug control and manipulation mailserver

   Just as request@bugs.debian.org allows the retrieval of bug data and
   documentation by email, control@bugs.debian.org allows bug reports to
   be manipulated in various ways.

   The control server works just like the request server, except that it
   has some additional commands; in fact, it's the same program. The two
   addresses are only separated to avoid users making mistakes and causing
   problems while merely trying to request information.

   Since the commands specific to the control server actually change the
   status of a bug, a notification about processing the commands is sent
   to the maintainer of the package(s) the changed bugs are assigned to.
   Additionally the mail to the server and the resulting changes are
   logged in the bug report and thereby available in the WWW pages.

   Please see the introduction to the request server available on the
   World Wide Web, in the file bug-log-mailserver.txt, or by sending help
   to either mailserver, for details of the basics of operating the
   mailservers and the common commands available when mailing either
   address.

   The reference card for the mailservers is available via the WWW, in
   bug-mailserver-refcard.txt or by email using the refcard command.

   reassign bugnumber package [ version ]
          Records that bug #bugnumber is a bug in package. This can be
          used to set the package if the user forgot the pseudo-header, or
          to change an earlier assignment. No notifications are sent to
          anyone (other than the usual information in the processing
          transcript).

          If you supply a version, the bug tracking system will note that
          the bug affects that version of the newly-assigned package.

          You can assign a bug to two packages at once by separating the
          package names with a comma. However, you should only do this if
          the bug can be fixed by a change to either package. If this is
          not the case, you should clone the bug and reassign the clone to
          the other package.

   reopen bugnumber [ originator-address | = | ! ]
          Reopens #bugnumber if it is closed.

          By default, or if you specify =, the original submitter is still
          as the originator of the report, so that they will get the ack
          when it is closed again.

          If you supply an originator-address the originator will be set
          to the address you supply. If you wish to become the new
          originator of the reopened report you can use the ! shorthand or
          specify your own email address.

          It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
          recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so
          that they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it
          is closed again.

          If the bug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even
          change the originator. To change the originator of an open bug
          report, use the submitter command; note that this will inform
          the original submitter of the change.

          If the bug was recorded as being closed in a particular version
          of a package but recurred in a later version, it is better to
          use the found command instead.

   found bugnumber [ version ]
          Record that #bugnumber has been encountered in the given version
          of the package to which it is assigned. version may be a fully
          qualified version, of the form sourcepackagename/version.

          The bug tracking system uses this information, in conjunction
          with fixed versions recorded when closing bugs, to display lists
          of bugs open in various versions of each package. It considers a
          bug to be open when it has no fixed version, or when it has been
          found more recently than it has been fixed.

          If no version is given, then the list of fixed versions for the
          bug is cleared. This is identical to the behaviour of reopen.
          version may be a fully qualified version, of the form
          sourcepackagename/version.

          This command will only cause a bug to be marked as not done if
          no version is specified, or if the version being marked found is
          equal to or greater than the highest version marked fixed. (If
          you are certain that you want the bug marked as not done, use
          reopen in conjunction with found.)

          This command was introduced in preference to reopen because it
          was difficult to add a version to that command's syntax without
          suffering ambiguity.

   notfound bugnumber version
          Remove the record that #bugnumber was encountered in the given
          version of the package to which it is assigned. version may be a
          fully qualified version, of the form sourcepackagename/version.

          This differs from closing the bug at that version in that the
          bug is not listed as fixed in that version either; no
          information about that version will be known. It is intended for
          fixing mistakes in the record of when a bug was found.

   fixed bugnumber version
          Indicate that bug #bugnumber was fixed in the given version of
          the package to which it is assigned. version may be a fully
          qualified version, of the form sourcepackagename/version.

          This does not cause the bug to be marked as closed, it merely
          adds another version in which the bug was fixed. Use the
          bugnumber-done address to close a bug and mark it fixed in a
          particular version.

   notfixed bugnumber version
          Remove the record that bug #bugnumber has been fixed in the
          given version. version may be a fully qualified version, of the
          form sourcepackagename/version.

          This command is equivalent to found followed by notfound (the
          found removes the fixed at a particular version, and notfound
          removes the found) with the exception that the bug is not
          reopened if the found version is greater than any existing fixed
          version. It is intended for fixing mistakes in the record of
          when a bug was fixed; in most cases, you actually want found,
          not notfixed.

   submitter bugnumber originator-address | !
          Changes the originator of #bugnumber to originator-address.

          If you wish to become the new originator of the report you can
          use the ! shorthand or specify your own email address.

          While the reopen command changes the originator of other bugs
          merged with the one being reopened, submitter does not affect
          merged bugs.

   forwarded bugnumber address
          Notes that bugnumber has been forwarded to the upstream
          maintainer at address. This does not actually forward the
          report. This can be used to change an existing incorrect
          forwarded-to address, or to record a new one for a bug that
          wasn't previously noted as having been forwarded. address should
          generally be a URI, or possibly an email address. Using a URI
          where possible allows tools to query a remote bug tracking
          system (such as bugzilla) for a bug's status.

          Example usage:

      forwarded 12345 http://bugz.illa.foo/cgi/54321

   notforwarded bugnumber
          Forgets any idea that bugnumber has been forwarded to any
          upstream maintainer. If the bug was not recorded as having been
          forwarded then this will do nothing.

   retitle bugnumber new-title
          Changes the title of a bug report to that specified (the default
          is the Subject mail header from the original report). Will also
          change the titles of all bug reports which this bug is merged
          with.

   severity bugnumber severity
          Set the severity level for bug report #bugnumber to severity. No
          notification is sent to the user who reported the bug.

          Severities are critical, grave, serious, important, normal,
          minor, wishlist, fixed.

          For their meanings please consult the general developers'
          documentation for the bug system.

   affects bugnumber [ + | - | = ] package [ package ... ]
          Indicates that a bug affects another package. In the case where
          bugnumber causes breakage in package even though the bug is
          actually present in the package to which it is assigned, this
          causes the bug to be listed by default in the package list of
          package. This should generally be used where the bug is severe
          enough to cause multiple reports from users to be assigned to
          the wrong package. = sets the affects to the list of packages
          given, and is the default action if no packages are given; -
          removes the given packages from the affects list; + adds the
          given packages to the affects list, and is the default if
          packages are given.

   summary bugnumber [message number | summary text]
          Selects a message to use as a summary of a bug. The first
          non-pseudoheader/non-control paragraph of that message is parsed
          and set as the summary of the bug which is displayed on the top
          of the bug report page. This is useful in cases where the
          original report doesn't correctly describe the problem or the
          bug has many messages which make it difficult to identify the
          actual problem.

          If message number is not given, clears the summary. message
          number is the message number as listed in the bugreport cgi
          script output; if a message number of 0 is given, the current
          message is used (that is, the message which was sent to
          control@bugs.debian.org which contains the summary control
          command).

          If message number is not numerical and not the empty string, it
          is assumed to be the text to set the summary to.

   outlook bugnumber [message number | outlook text]
          Selects a message to use as the outlook for fixing a bug (or the
          current status of fixing a bug). The first
          non-pseudoheader/non-control paragraph of that message is parsed
          and set as the outlook of the bug which is displayed on the top
          of the bug report page. This is useful to coordinate with others
          who are working on fixing this bug (for example, in an bug
          squashing party).

          If message number is not given, clears the outlook. message
          number is the message number as listed in the bugreport cgi
          script output; if a message number of 0 is given, the current
          message is used (that is, the message which was sent to
          control@bugs.debian.org which contains the outlook control
          command).

          If message number is not numerical and not the empty string, it
          is assumed to be the text to set the outlook to.

   clone bugnumber NewID [ new IDs ... ]
          The clone control command allows you to duplicate a bug report.
          It is useful in the case where a single report actually
          indicates that multiple distinct bugs have occurred. "New IDs"
          are negative numbers, separated by spaces, which may be used in
          subsequent control commands to refer to the newly duplicated
          bugs. A new report is generated for each new ID.

          Example usage:

          clone 12345 -1 -2
          reassign -1 foo
          retitle -1 foo: foo sucks
          reassign -2 bar
          retitle -2 bar: bar sucks when used with foo
          severity -2 wishlist
          clone 123456 -3
          reassign -3 foo
          retitle -3 foo: foo sucks
          merge -1 -3

   merge bugnumber bugnumber ...
          Merges two or more bug reports. When reports are merged opening,
          closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any
          of the bugs to a new package will have an identical effect on
          all of the merged reports.

          Before bugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same
          state: either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to
          upstream author address or all not marked as forwarded, all
          assigned to the same package or package(s) (an exact string
          comparison is done on the package to which the bug is assigned),
          and all of the same severity. If they don't start out in the
          same state you should use reassign, reopen and so forth to make
          sure that they are before using merge. Titles are not required
          to match, and will not be affected by the merge. Tags are not
          required to match, either, they will be joined.

          If any of the bugs listed in a merge command is already merged
          with another bug then all the reports merged with any of the
          ones listed will all be merged together. Merger is like
          equality: it is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.

          Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs;
          on the WWW pages this is includes links to the other bugs.

          Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all
          of the reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.

   forcemerge bugnumber bugnumber ...
          Forcibly merges two or more bug reports. The settings of the
          first bug listed which must be equal in a normal merge are
          assigned to the bugs listed next. To avoid typos erroneously
          merging bugs, bugs must be in the same package. See the text
          above for a description of what merging means.

          Note that this makes it possible to close bugs by merging; you
          are responsible for notifying submitters with an appropriate
          close message if you do this.

   unmerge bugnumber
          Disconnects a bug report from any other reports with which it
          may have been merged. If the report listed is merged with
          several others then they are all left merged with each other;
          only their associations with the bug explicitly named are
          removed.

          If many bug reports are merged and you wish to split them into
          two separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each
          report in one of the new groups separately and then merge them
          into the required new group.

          You can only unmerge one report with each unmerge command; if
          you want to disconnect more than one bug simply include several
          unmerge commands in your message.

   tags bugnumber [ + | - | = ] tag [ tag ... ] [ + | - | = tag ... ] ]
          Sets tags for the bug report #bugnumber. No notification is sent
          to the user who reported the bug. Setting the action to + means
          to add each tag following, - means to remove each tag following,
          and = means to set the following tags to the list provided.
          Intervening +, -, or = change the action for the tags following.
          The default action is adding.

          Example usage:

          # same as 'tags 123456 + patch'
          tags 123456 patch

          # same as 'tags 123456 + help security'
          tags 123456 help security

          # add 'fixed' and 'pending' tags
          tags 123456 + fixed pending

          # remove 'unreproducible' tag
          tags 123456 - unreproducible

          # set tags to exactly 'moreinfo' and 'unreproducible'
          tags 123456 = moreinfo unreproducible

          # remove the moreinfo tag and add a patch tag
          tags 123456 - moreinfo + patch

          Available tags currently include patch, wontfix, moreinfo,
          unreproducible, help, pending, security, upstream, confirmed,
          fixed, fixed-upstream, fixed-in-experimental, d-i, ipv6, lfs,
          l10n, potato, woody, sarge, sarge-ignore, etch, etch-ignore,
          lenny, lenny-ignore, squeeze, squeeze-ignore, wheezy,
          wheezy-ignore, jessie, jessie-ignore, sid, experimental.

          For their meanings please consult the general developers'
          documentation for the bug system.

   block bugnumber by bug ...
          Note that the fix for the first bug is blocked by the other
          listed bugs.

   unblock bugnumber by bug ...
          Note that the fix for the first bug is no longer blocked by the
          other listed bugs.

   close bugnumber [ fixed-version ] (deprecated)
          Close bug report #bugnumber.

          A notification is sent to the user who reported the bug, but (in
          contrast to mailing bugnumber-done@bugs.debian.org) the text of
          the mail which caused the bug to be closed is not included in
          that notification. The maintainer who closes a report needs to
          ensure, probably by sending a separate message, that the user
          who reported the bug knows why it is being closed. The use of
          this command is therefore deprecated. See the developer's
          information about how to close a bug properly.

          If you supply a fixed-version, the bug tracking system will note
          that the bug was fixed in that version of the package.

   package [ packagename ... ]
          Limits the following commands so that they will only apply to
          bugs filed against the listed packages. You can list one or more
          packages. If you don't list any packages, the following commands
          will apply to all bugs. You're encouraged to use this as a
          safety feature in case you accidentally use the wrong bug
          numbers.

          Example usage:

          package foo
          reassign 123456 bar 1.0-1

          package bar
          retitle 123456 bar: bar sucks
          severity 123456 normal

          package
          severity 234567 wishlist

   owner bugnumber address | !
          Sets address to be the "owner" of #bugnumber. The owner of a bug
          claims responsibility for fixing it. This is useful to share out
          work in cases where a package has a team of maintainers.

          If you wish to become the owner of the bug yourself, you can use
          the ! shorthand or specify your own email address.

   noowner bugnumber
          Forgets any idea that the bug has an owner other than the usual
          maintainer. If the bug had no owner recorded then this will do
          nothing.

   archive bugnumber
          Archives a bug that had been archived at some point in the past
          but is currently not archived if the bug fulfills the
          requirements for archival, ignoring time.

   unarchive bugnumber
          Unarchives a bug that was previously archived. Unarchival should
          generally be coupled with reopen and found/fixed as appropriate.
          Bugs that have been unarchived can be archived using archive
          assuming the non-time based archival requirements are met. You
          should not be using unarchive to make trivial changes to
          archived bugs, such as changing the submitter; its primary
          purpose is to allow for the reopening of bugs which have been
          archived without the intervention of BTS administrators.

   #...
          One-line comment. The # must be at the start of the line. The
          text of comments will be included in the acknowledgement sent to
          the sender and to affected maintainers, so you can use this to
          document the reasons for your commands.
